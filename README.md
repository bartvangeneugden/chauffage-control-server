Chauffage Control
=================

Small webapp where a user can control multiple switchs. Either turn them `on`, `off` or `on with timer`. This in turn exports to a simple API.

The goal for this webapp is to feed a raspberry PI with a bunch of relays attached to it. The Pi will poll the API on a regular basis and react accodringly. See [chauffage-control-client](https://github.com/bartvangeneugden/chauffage-control-client)
